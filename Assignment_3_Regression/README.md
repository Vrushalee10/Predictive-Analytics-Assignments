### **ðŸš€ Steps to Create `README.md` for Assignment 3**
1. **In the "Name your file..." box**, type:
   ```
   README.md
   ```
2. **Copy & Paste the following content** into the editor:

```md
# ðŸ“Š Assignment 3: Predicting Used Car Prices (Regression)

This assignment focuses on **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict the price of **used Toyota Corolla cars** based on their specifications.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Overview
- **1436 records** of used cars
- **38 attributes** (Age, KM, Fuel Type, HP, etc.)
- **Target Variable:** `Price` (in Euros)

## ðŸ“Œ Techniques Used
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Backward & Forward Feature Selection
- Model Evaluation (RÂ², MAE, RMSE)
- Data Normalization

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- **Most important features:** Age, Kilometers, Fuel Type, Automatic Air Conditioning
- **Best Model Performance:** 
  - RÂ² = **0.88** (88% variance explained)
  - MAE = **â‚¬929.57**

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Navigate to this folder:
   ```sh
   cd Assignment_3_Regression
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook notebooks/MGS_616_HW3_Group1_code.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.

### **ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps**
âœ… **Check if the Assignment 3 hyperlink works in the main README.**  
âœ… **Upload your Jupyter Notebook and Report inside this folder.**  
âœ… **Repeat for other assignments if needed.**
